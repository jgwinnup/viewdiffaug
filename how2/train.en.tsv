1	And I call them decorative elements because basically all they're meant to do is to enrich and color the page.
2	So they don't really have much of a symbolic meaning other than maybe life is richer, life is beautiful, but they've become so beautifully stylized and so you find them in different illuminative being rendered in very different ways.
3	Now this is very, this is actually an insert of a kind of an envelope for stationary, and this is a very Italian design.
4	This is all the you know, take off on the idea of the acanthus leaf.
5	It's almost has a feathery like posture to it.
6	And so, it's used in architecture as a decorative element in architecture on columns and so on, and it's also used a great deal in illumination.
7	And so what's happened with the idea of acanthus leaf, is that it has is taken on all these different creative looks.
8	And it has been wildly colored so you can look at some an acanthus leaf and you can start with the idea of a black and white drawing.

10	Hi.
11	My name is Dr. Art Bowler.
12	Are you always focused on the positive aspects of your physical self instead of the negative?
13	If so you have high self esteem.
14	Low self esteem tends to bring us down and there's a set of thoughts or cognitions that tend to go with low self esteem.
15	Such as I am unlove, unlovable and no one will like me.
16	By doing cognitive therapy and working on those thoughts, we can help our clients to feel better about themselves by gaining a more accurate appraisal of themselves, their situation and their environment.
17	It's really important to notice if you have low self esteem because then you can do something about it.
18	This is Dr. Art Bowler and this has been how to tell if you have low self esteem.
19	And I'm a psychologist in Manhattan, New York City, where I have my own private practice.
20	In this clip I'm going to talk about how to tell if you have low self esteem.
21	Low self esteem or a low feeling about oneself is unfortunately very common.
22	But fortunately it's very fixable.
23	When one has low self esteem, the way you can tell is look in the mirror.
24	How do you feel about yourself?
25	What do you see?
